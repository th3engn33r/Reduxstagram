# Learn Redux

A simple React + Redux implementation. This will be turned into a free video series once the app is totally fleshed out.

## Running

First `npm install` to grab all the necessary dependencies. 

Then run `npm start` and open <localhost:7770> in your browser.

## Production Build

Run `npm build` to create a distro folder and a bundle.js file.

P.S : This program was developed as guided tutorial by Wes Bros in his lesson Learn Redux. It was my first attempt to learn & work with Redux. I followed all steps as told in tutorial, used boilerplate provided by Wes Bros
